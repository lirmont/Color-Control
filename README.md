# Color Control and Documentation

## Overview

![Selection Mode](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lirmont/Color-Control/master/Documentation/Media/Interface-Color-Comparison.png)

Pick colors in the HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color scheme. Compare those colors to other colors in selection mode. Step from those colors to other colors in a variety of different color schemes (HSV, RGB, CIE XYZ, CIE Lab*) in palette mode.

Colors are automatically laid out from the location of the active color. This view is zoomable via the mousewheel, and it's draggable via middle-click. The default color scheme used for stepping is a perceptual based color scheme (as opposed to a programmatically generated scheme of colors, like HSV and RGB).
